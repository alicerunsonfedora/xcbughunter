# Bug Bounty!
Fix as many bugs in your codebase as possible.

Hey, pal! I've been working on a small project lately for Boring Tech Company Industries, some new fancy app or whatever. The problem is that I can't quite get all the bugs out; would you be able to take a look and fix them for me?

**Bug Bounty!** is a small, fast-paced game where you need to look for the bugs and squash as many as you can in a minute. This game was designed for the 129th Trigram game jam.

You can play the game at https://marquiskurt.itch.io/bug-bounty.
